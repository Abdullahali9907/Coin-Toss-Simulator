# Coin-Toss-Simulator
The Coin Toss Simulator is a simple web-based tool that mimics the flipping of a real coin. When the user clicks the "Toss" button, the simulator randomly generates either "Heads" or "Tails" and displays the result on the screen, often with a corresponding coin image or animation.
